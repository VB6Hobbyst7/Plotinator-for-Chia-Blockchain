# Plotinator-for-Chia-Blockchain

The Plotinator was designed for Windows 10. 
It automatically starts the next plot as soon as the Phase 1 is done. 

# Plotinator

1) Install the chia blockchain on your computer. Start chia and create a wallet. 
2) Then you can leave Chia. The chain does not necessarily have to be syncronized.
3) Start the Plotinator and select the chia version.

Have fun!
