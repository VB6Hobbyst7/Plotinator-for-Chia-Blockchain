# Plotinator for Chia-Blockchain

The Plotinator was designed for Windows 10. 
Plotinator automatically starts the next Plot as soon as the "Phase 1" is done. 


# START

1) Install the Chia-Blockchain on your PC. Start Chia and create a wallet. 
2) Then you can leave Chia. The chain does not necessarily have to be syncronized.
3) Start the Plotinator and select the Chia-Version.

Have fun!
